## Code Execution 
just type out your code and click run (only works with Python) and not terminal base games beacuse as of right now any code that promts u to type in output terminal will crash the app. i.e a termnal calcultor or number guessing game using the terminal and so on but it will run full python code like making a app with tkinter and so on\ i have made a mini pygame window with a object moving in it so you can make stuff you the code executer 

## Terminal Widget 
you should be able to use all basic window commands like 
- dir
- time /t
- date /t

and so on. 
the terminal is a litte buggy and will crash if u type the commands wrong ( i need to add better error handling for it)

if u want to customize background and text of termnial just use these commands 
- set bgcolor blue
- set fgcolor red

list of colors for terminal:
- red
- blue
- green
- cyan
- yellow
- white
- lime
  and more

## Example.py is the file you can use to run the code or make your own file to run the widget 

directory should look like this:
